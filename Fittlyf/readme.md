# Customersâ€™ two years transaction detail

This project involves addressing four distinct challenges across different departments: Marketing, Operation, Retail Products, and Customer Relationship Management. Each department has specific objectives, and we'll develop models or strategies to meet their needs.

## 1. Marketing
### Objective:
Cluster customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and derive marketing strategies for each cluster.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare RFM data for customer segmentation.
2. **Modeling**: Employ clustering algorithms to segment customers into 3-4 clusters.
3. **Justification**: Quantitatively justify the chosen clustering model based on silhouette score, elbow method, or other relevant metrics.
4. **Marketing Strategies**: Derive strategies for each cluster based on their characteristics.

## 2. Operation Team
### Objective:
Forecast daily sales at the country level for the next 2 months to ensure sufficient stock for the next quarter.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preparation**: Gather historical sales data at the country level.
2. **Modeling**: Develop a time series forecasting model to predict daily sales.
3. **Justification**: Quantitatively justify the chosen forecasting model based on performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
4. **Stock Management**: Derive strategies based on sales forecasts to manage stock effectively.

## 3. Retail Products Team
### Objective:
Optimize shelf arrangements in stores to promote cross-selling and upselling, starting with suggesting the 'next best product in line' for the top 10 selling stock codes.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preparation**: Utilize ABI index to identify products frequently bought together.
2. **Modeling**: Develop a recommendation system to suggest the next best product.
3. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to represent product associations and seasonality.
4. **Shelf Arrangement**: Propose shelf arrangements based on product associations and seasonality trends.

## 4. Customer Relationship Management
### Objective:
Reduce churn rate by identifying customers at risk of churning and optimizing retention initiatives.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preparation**: Collect customer data including churn status.
2. **Modeling**: Build a churn prediction model to identify at-risk customers.
3. **Justification**: Quantitatively justify the chosen model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
4. **Retention Strategies**: Develop strategies to retain at-risk customers based on churn prediction insights.
